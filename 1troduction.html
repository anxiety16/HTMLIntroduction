            <h2>Plot of the Story</h2>
            <p>Hidden Figures tells the story of three African American women—Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson—who 
                worked at NASA during the early 1960s. Despite working in segregated facilities, their exceptional mathematical and engineering 
                talents were essential in helping the United States succeed in the space race against the Soviet Union. The movie focuses on their 
                individual struggles with racial and gender discrimination, while highlighting their vital contributions to John Glenn’s orbit around the 
                Earth. Their triumphs not only advanced NASA’s missions but also challenged societal norms about race and gender.</p>

            <h2>Setting of the Story</h2>
            <p>The movie is set in the United States during the 1960s, a time marked by both the space race and the civil rights movement. NASA's
                 research center, the Langley Research Center in Virginia, serves as the primary setting. The movie also captures other key locations of 
                 the time, including segregated workspaces and classrooms, underscoring the systemic inequalities of the era. The political atmosphere 
                 is tense, with intense pressure on NASA to succeed in space exploration, while society grapples with racial segregation and inequality.</p>

            <h2>Characters of the Story</h2>
            <p>Hidden Figures is an incredibly inspiring film that shows how determination, intelligence, and perseverance can overcome systemic 
                barriers. The movie shines a light on the unsung heroes of history, highlighting the significance of diversity in fields like science and 
                technology. Watching the characters navigate and ultimately challenge the limitations placed upon them is both emotional and 
                empowering. The film sends a powerful message that no matter who you are or where you come from, your talents and hard work can change the world.</p>
